# Telegram Bing AI and DALLÂ·E 3 bot

This project is a Telegram bot that uses the aiogram library for bot creation, the Dalle3 library for image generation, and Bing's ChatGPT for conversation generation. The bot maintains isolated threads of messages, responds to commands and messages from users, and generates images based on user prompts.

## Main Features
